      "Ace Combat Advance is a 2005 air combat video game in the Ace Combat series. Developed by Hungarian studio Humansoft, it is the first in the series for a handheld gaming system and, unlike the usual flight simulation games in the Ace Combat series, it is a top-down shooter similar to Strike, but using fighter jets rather than helicopters. It has been criticized for awkward controls, lack of appeal, difficulty and very poor graphics. Unlike other Ace Combat games, a Japanese release for the title was absent.",
